Imports:

express: This is the core Express.js library used to create web applications.
crypto: This library provides cryptographic functionalities, used here to generate unique IDs for movies.
cors: This middleware enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing requests from different origins to access the API.
movies: This requires the movies.json file, likely containing an array of movie objects that will be served by the API.
validateMovie and validatePartialMovie: These functions, imported from the schemas/movies directory, are likely used for data validation of movie objects.
Application Setup:

const app = express(): Creates an Express application instance.
app.use(express.json()): This middleware parses incoming JSON data in request bodies, making it accessible through req.body.
app.use(cors({ ... })): This configures the CORS middleware to allow requests from specific origins listed in the ACCEPTED_ORIGINS array (you can adjust this to fit your needs). Additionally, it allows requests without an origin header.
app.disable('x-powered-by'): This disables the X-Powered-By: Express header for security reasons (you might not always want to reveal the server software).
API Endpoints:

GET /movies: Retrieves a list of all movies. Optionally takes a genre query parameter to filter movies based on genre (case-insensitive).
GET /movies/:id: Retrieves a specific movie by its ID. Returns a 404 error if not found.
POST /movies: Creates a new movie. The request body should contain movie data in JSON format. Validation is performed using validateMovie. On successful validation, a new movie object with a generated ID is added to the movies array (not a true database interaction) and a 201 (Created) response is sent.
DELETE /movies/:id: Deletes a movie by its ID. Returns a 404 error if not found.
PATCH /movies/:id: Partially updates a movie by its ID. The request body should contain the update data in JSON format. Validation is performed using validatePartialMovie. On successful validation, the corresponding movie object is updated in the movies array and the updated movie is returned in the response.
Error Handling:

Validation errors in POST and PATCH requests result in a 400 (Bad Request) response with the error details.
Movie not found errors in GET, DELETE, and PATCH requests result in a 404 (Not Found) response with an appropriate message.
Server Startup:

const PORT = process.env.PORT ?? 1234: Sets the port number for the server. It will use the environment variable PORT if defined, otherwise it defaults to 1234.
app.listen(PORT, ...): Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port. Logs a message to the console when the server is listening.
Important Notes:

In-Memory Data: This example stores movie data in the movies array, which is not persistent and will be lost when the server restarts. For a production API, consider using a database.
CORS Configuration: Adjust the ACCEPTED_ORIGINS list to control which origins can access your API.
Security: This is a basic example and might not have all the necessary security measures in place. Consider implementing additional security features in production environments.
